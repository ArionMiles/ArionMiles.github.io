I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad from Mumbai, India.

Outside of classes I am working on my skills as a fullstack developer, learning new stuff, and love to build solutions to
real life problems using programming.

I'm currently looking for full-time Junior Software Engineering roles. If you'd like to chat, you can reach out to me at `kanishk@arionmiles.me`

You can see my resume [here](/pdfs/resume.pdf).
