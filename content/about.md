I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad from Mumbai, India.

Outside of classes I am working on my skills as a fullstack developer, learning new stuff, and love to build solutions to
real life problems using programming.

I'm currently looking for internships as a fullstack or backend developer. If you like what you see, you can reach out to me at `singh dot kanishk07 at gmail dot com`

You can see my resume [here](/pdfs/resume.pdf).
