I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad from Mumbai, India. In my leisure time, I play video games, browse the web aimlessly, read other, better tech blogs, and listen to music, watch a good Sci-Fi movie/series.

Outside of classes I study Machine Learning, attend hackathons, and build solutions to
real life problems using programming.

You can see my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GoRRq8p1YyQyMsv-ktsDy4Qd6itqgpVA), and my projects 
[here](/projects/).
