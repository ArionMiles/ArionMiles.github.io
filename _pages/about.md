I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad from Mumbai, India. In my leisure time, I'm playing video games, browsing the web aimlessly, reading other tech blogs, and listening to music.

Outside of classes I am working my way towards Machine Learning, attending hackathons, and building solutions to
real life problems using programming.

You can see my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GoRRq8p1YyQyMsv-ktsDy4Qd6itqgpVA), and my projects 
[here](/projects/).
